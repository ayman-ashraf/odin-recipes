    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
      Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the royal khansamas of the
      durbar of Old Delhi, under the Mughal Empire, during the late 16th century
      of the erstwhile Mughal Court.[1] It is made with Indian spices, rice, and
      usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, fish) or in
      some cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and
      potatoes.[2]
